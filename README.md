# BBO Order Book Simulator

This is a **single-symbol Limit Order Book simulator** built in C++. It processes buy and sell limit orders, maintains an order book, and matches orders based on price-time priority.

The project focuses on **BBO (Best Bid and Offer)** logic â€” always tracking the highest bid and lowest ask for a single stock.
